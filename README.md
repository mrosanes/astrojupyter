**astrojupyter** has been developed during the group practical work of the 
Master of Astronomy & Astrophysics at VIU (Valencia International University)  

This practical work was composed by:  
- Observations and Data Acquisition in the OSN (Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Andalusia): our 
objective was to observe the primary & secondary transit of WASP-33b and the raw pulsations of its star WASP-33. 
Data has been acquired for the WASP-33 raw pulsations (evening of 15/11/2021) and the primary transit of WASP-33b 
(single night from 16-17/11/2021). The secondary transit could not be acquired due to bad weather conditions during 
the rest of the nights assigned in the OSN for this project.
- Data Analysis of the acquired data: preprocessing with image reduction, normalization, and 
differential photometry, and postprocessing with the analysis of the obtained light curves.  

This project contains some Python Jupyter-Notebooks related to the postprocessing of the 
light curves obtained with the differential photometry.
